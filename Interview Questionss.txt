Hi Bipasha,

here is summarised questions:-

Introduction and discussion on the project and its architecture.
Implement an immutable class and discuss various questions related to access modifiers.
What is the difference between the equals() and hashCode() methods?
You are given a list of Employee objects. You need to calculate the average salary for a specific department.
double avgSalary = employees.stream()
        .filter(e -> e.getDept().equals("IT"))   // filter by department
        .mapToDouble(Employee::getSalary)       // get salary as double
        .average()                               // compute average
        .orElse(0.0);                            // return 0 if no employee in that dept

System.out.println("Average salary for IT: " + avgSalary);



How would the equals() method look for this Employee class?
  @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (this == obj) return true;           // same reference
        if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) return false; // null or different class

        Employee other = (Employee) obj;        // cast
        return this.id == other.id;             // compare unique field
    }

What is Serializable, and what do we need to do to make a class serializable?
Question on spring boot annotations and spring
Given a rotated sorted array, return the second minimum element from the array in O(log n) time complexity.
	int[] num= {4,5,6,7,1,2,3};
	int n = num.length;
	int left=0, right=n-1;
	while(left<right) {
		int mid=(left+right)/2;
		if(num[mid]>num[right]) {
			left=mid+1;
		}else {
			right=mid;
		}
	}
	
	int p=left;
	System.out.println(num[(p+1)%n]);

Given a number, determine its type:
Binary → if all digits are 0 or 1
Octal → if all digits are less than or equal to 7
Number → if any digit is greater than 7

String s="10601";
boolean b=s.chars().allMatch(c-> c=='0' || c=='1');
boolean o=s.chars().allMatch(c-> c>='0' && c<='7');
if(b) System.out.println("binary");
else if(o) System.out.println("octal");
else  System.out.println("Number");

Discussion on LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN.

About : Kafka working.

If you have large file in server A . It has been divided in to small files and sent server B. How you will collect all the small chunks and get the real file.
Chunking: File is divided into parts, each with a sequence number (e.g., file.part1, file.part2).
Transfer: Chunks are sent to Server B over network (HTTP, TCP, SFTP, etc.).
Reconstruction: On Server B, read all chunks in order and write them sequentially to a new file.
Use streams (BufferedInputStream/OutputStream) to efficiently read/write bytes.
Verification: Checksum/hash (MD5/SHA) to ensure the reconstructed file matches the original.


You have nested objects and Integers are in an Object array, you need to make a list of integers from that Objects array.

1) WAQ to find latest order for each customer
 
output fields 
Customer_id, first_name, last_name, age, order id, item
 
Input: weight[] = [4, 3, 2, 6]
Output: 29
 
2) merge and compress these network packets
 
cost to merge and compress any 2 packets is 
sum of the cost of both the packets
 
you have to find the way to minimize the cost to join and compress all the packets
 
2 + 3 = 5
Now I have 5, 4,6
 
4 + 5 = 9
Now I have 9, 6
 
9+16 = 15
Now I have just one ntwork packet which is 15
 
total cost 5 + 9 + 15 = 29

nput: [1, 3, 11, 5, 2]
Output: 42

First connect 1+2(=3), 
then 3+3(=6), 
6+5(=11), 
11+11(=22). 
 
Total cost is 42 (3+6+11+22)

Ya 
Normal like introduce yourself 
then he asked me why I wanted to join wissen.

Then one logical question no need to code 
The question was if the digit clock value is given then you are required to tell the clockwise angle it makes if that value is converted to analog clock.
minute=minute*6
hour=(hour%12)*30+minute*0.5
total=hour-minute
360-total
Like ex: 9:30 time then in analog it makes 270 degrees between hour and minute line.

Then one java coding questions 

Input: [1,2,[3,4],5,[6]]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6]

That is here we should print all the numbers from the above input where input contains the numbers and arrays in an array.

That's it.

Given ‘N’ ropes with different lengths, we need to connect these ropes into one big rope with minimum cost. The cost of connecting two ropes is equal to the sum of their lengths.
 
 
Input: [1, 3, 11, 5]

Output: 33
 
 
First connect 1+3 =4, 
then 4+5 =9, 
then 9+11 =20. 
So total cost is 33 (4+9+20)

2.Given a string s and an integer k, find the length of the longest substring that contains at most k
distinct characters
Input:
String s = "eceba";
int k = 2;
Explanation:
The substrings with at most 2 distinct characters are:
"ec" (distinct characters: e, c)
"ece" (distinct characters: e, c)
"ec" (distinct characters: e, c)
"eba" (distinct characters: e, b, a) → Invalid (has 3 distinct characters)
The longest valid substring is "ece", which has a length of 3.

2.You have to design a solution (classes, interfaces, etc etc) for DeckofCards. Each card has a suit (heart,

6.Can palindrome be formed?
Given a string, check if palindrome can be formed by rearranging its characters.
Ex1. string: bangalore ans : false
Ex2. string: abdybayd ans : true because string can be rearranged as abdyydba
Expected time complexity - O(n)
Space complexity - O(n)
Map<Character, Long> collect = s.chars().mapToObj(c-> (char)c).collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Function.identity(),Collectors.counting()));
	long count = collect.values().stream().filter(n-> n%2!=0).count();
	System.out.println(count<=1);
